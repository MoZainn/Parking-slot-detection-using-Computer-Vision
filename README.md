# Parking-slot-detection-using-Computer-Vision

ðŸš— Parking Spot Detection using OpenCV
This project implements an intelligent parking monitoring system that detects vacant and occupied parking spots from video footage using image processing techniques in OpenCV.

ðŸ“¹ Demo
The system processes a video stream (.mp4) of a parking lot and overlays bounding boxes on each parking spot:

ðŸŸ© Green for available spots

ðŸŸ¥ Red for occupied spots

It also displays the total number of available parking spots in real time.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Dynamic difference-based frame comparison for spot change detection

Efficient processing using frame skipping (adjustable via step)

Parking spot segmentation from a binary mask

Modular design using helper functions (util.py)
